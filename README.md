# npm-setup-util

This script will autogenerate an NPM skeleton. To use, download this file into your main project directory and run `./npm_setup.sh`.

By default, your entry file will be named the same as your project. I.e., running this setup script in a directory named `my_project` will title your entry file `my_project.jsx`.
